# Smart Security Application

## Introduction

Taking care of events happening in a video surveillance area is a complex task. The security system cameras are sending visual information to the main system online and the end-user (commonly a security guard) could not be able to pay attention to all the visual information.

 The Smart Security application aims to support the security guard to prevent risk situations and consequently improve the quality of life of the people who live in the surveillance area.

The Smart Security application will focus on detecting and analyzing security risk such as, theft, access controls, people detection, fights, crowd analysis, etc., through the combination of video cameras and mobile sensors, in both, indoor and outdoor scenarios, for instance, parking lots and buildings.
